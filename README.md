# E-Commerce App

## Description
This is the back-end or server side part of a sample e-commerce app.  It is a database using Sequelize, MYSQL, running on an express.js setup.  I defined the models and routes, and the database was activated with sample seed data.  The API testing was done using Insomnia, which is the focus of the linked video.
